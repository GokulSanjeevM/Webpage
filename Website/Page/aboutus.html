          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>Café Coffee Day, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, is India’s favourite hangout for coffee and
            conversations.
            Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide the best experience to our guests. Our coffees are sourced from
            thousands
            of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives. We opened
            our first
            cafe in 1996 at Brigade Road in Bangalore – the youth and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe,
            and
            it
            continues to be one of the most happening places in the city. CCD to the youth is a “hangout” spot where
            they
            meet
            people, make conversations, and have a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee.It's been an
            exciting journey
            since then to becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in the country.</p>

            institutions, Amber
            Valley Residential School and SVGH Vocational Training College.The SVGH Vocational Training College was
            established in
            April 2005 by the Trust with an aim to bridge the gap between the urban and rural youth by training the
            economically
            underprivileged and making sure they land placements. Over 1300 students celebrate this opportunity to
            develop their
